## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
A Linear Regression was preformed to help predict which variables predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
The linear regression above shows that the variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset are the vehicle_length and ground_clearance. 

## Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

No, because the p value is 5.35e-11, which is smaller then the significance leevl of 0.05 and so we woudl reject our null hypothesis. 

## Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

It does because the model has an r-squared value of 0.71 and this indicates that 71% of mpg predictions can be figured out through this model.
